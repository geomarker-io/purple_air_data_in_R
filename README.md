## About

This is an vignette for users of PurpleAir sensors to obtain real-time air pollution and meteorological data and to explore various ways of basic data analysis from PurpleAir data. The GitHub site here contains all the files needed for the user to get started quering and exploring PurpleAir data. This project is a part of **R**esearch **I**nnovations using **S**ensor Technology in **E**nvironmental Justice Communities (**RISE Communities**) to provide technical training in the application of low-cost sensors for indoor, outdoor, and personal air monitoring in Environmental Justice communities. The GitHub page is part of the RISE program hosted at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center August 1-3, 2023.

## Goals

-   Install R and RStudio on a computer.

-   Explore how to use the RStudio environment.

-   Explain how to install and load R packages necessary for this vignette.

-   Become familiar with the [PurpleAir API dashboard](https://develop.purpleair.com/keys), including creating projects and API Keys.

-   Create or load PurpleAir Synoptic (PAS) data objects in R and explore it using interactive maps.

-   Create or load PurpleAir Time Series (PAT) data objects in R and explore it using time series plots.

## Prerequisites

-   A computer running either Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems to install and run R and RStudio.

-   A stable internet connection.

-   A [Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) or [GMail account](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/56256?hl=en).

It is not necessary for the user to know how to use R before beginning this tutorial. Sections have been added to the vignette to teach the user how to install R and RStudio and to learn enough R skills to become familiar with its R commands. If you are already familiar with how to use R, no additional knowledge is necessary to work through this exercise.

## Getting Started

Click [here](https://geomarker.io/purple_air_data_in_R/) to access the vignette, or click the URL link under the **About** section on the GitHub page. This should open an HTML document of the vignette.

It is highly recommended that you follow along with the HTML vignette by setting up and running the R code provided on your computer to get the most out of this tutorial. For your convenience, we have taken the R code listed in the HTML document and saved it in an R script `purpleair.R`. You can file this file listed at the top of the GitHub page.
